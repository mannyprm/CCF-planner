# Cape Christian Fellowship - Sermon Planning System

A web-based sermon planning and management system designed for Cape Christian. Where each planning meeting has its own space. For example, the Series Planning meeting has its own meeting space powered by something like https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg. The meeting space includes relevant teams, the main person delivering the message, scriptures, topics, trends, themes, etc., to consider. The Sermon Preparation Timeline is fully editable. 

Anyone who logs in can see the planning sessions, meetings, calendar, etc. There is version history to rollback or review previous saved or auto-saved versions.
